legend=_("Makhnovia was a portion of Southeastern Ukraine until \ 
 invaded by the former Soviet Union. Makhnovia, also known as the Free Territory, \
 resulted from an attempt to form a stateless anarchist society in parts of Ukraine \
 during the Russian Revolution of 1917â€“23. It existed from 1918 to 1921, during which time \
 free soviets and libertarian communes operated under the protection of Nestor Makhno's \
 Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army. The area had a population of around seven million. ")
