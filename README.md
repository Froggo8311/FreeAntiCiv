Freeciv is a Free and Open Source empire-building strategy game inspired by the history of human civilization. Freeanticiv aims to be not that. Read The Dawn of Everything by Graeber/Wengrow. Also hi I'm Thufie, the dev.

This is basically just anarchist civs for freeciv. For now. Of course this being based off a 90s "civ" game made in the united states there is a lot to unpack ideologically in its design, so *baby steps* with regards to ruleset changes and UI design changes *for now*.

- *Finished* Revolutionary Catalonia
- Rojava
 - Todo: More cities
- *Finished* EZLN
- *Finished* Paris Commune
- *Finished* Free Territory (Makhnovia)
- *Finished* Shinmin Province / Korean People's Association in Manchuria


## Contributing

Things that I could use help with and/or should do myself:

- Edit these anarchy/nation/($civname).ruleset files with more historically appropriate city names. Keep in mind to use the romanization system of the language used by the city or civ. Right now only a cursory look has been done to ensure marginally-appropriate city names appear. I'm not a historian.
    - Rojava (Add more towns and city names!)
    - EZLN (Add more towns and city names!)
- Add historically relevant revolutionaries, military tacticians, and thinkers as "leaders" for each civ.
- Research additional civs to be added
